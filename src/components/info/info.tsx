              My lifelong aspiration was to become a cartographer. Ever since I
              was young, I would sketch maps and envision vast terrains. There
              was always something deeply compelling about the visual aspect for
              me. As time went on, my interest evolved into storytelling. It was
              when I encountered the world of cinema and photography that things
              clicked for me. I realized that visual art and storytelling, the
              craft of map-making and narrative weaving, could converge in the
              creation of scripts and the birth of characters from the ground
              up. This marked the beginning of my dream turning into tangible
              reality.

              Pursuing my education, I earned a degree in Film Studies. The
              enchanting and intricate world of cinema completely engulfed me.
              My fascination with fictional narratives grew profoundly during my
              time at EFTI’s International Film Master, where I delved deeper
              into the art form. It was a journey that further solidified my
              path and passion in the realm of visual storytelling.

              Vincenzo Solari, a name that I came to embrace, became synonymous
              with my journey. My experiences at EFTI opened a myriad of
              opportunities where I could blend my early love for cartography
              with my newfound passion for cinema. Every script I wrote, every
              scene I envisioned, was a map of its own – a landscape of
              emotions, stories, and characters waiting to be navigated and
              explored. The amalgamation of my childhood dreams and my
              professional aspirations crafted a unique path that I walked with
              fervor and dedication, making each step a testament to my
              commitment to the art of visual and narrative storytelling.
